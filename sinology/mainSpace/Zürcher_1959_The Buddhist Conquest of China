> "embassies and tribute from the Western Region, notably from Shanshan (Lop nor), Khotan, Kuch®, Qara·®hr and Ferghana, in the years 271, 283, 285 and 287"
> "emissaries from the Southern states of Linyi (Champa) and Funan (the region of the lower Mekong)in 268, 284, 285, 286, 287, and 289."
—Buddhism under the Western Jin; general remarks 59
> "The sudden flourishing of Buddhism in Northern China in the period 265-300 AD is directly connected with the close communications which existed between that part of the empire and the Buddhist countries of Central Asia."
[[絲綢之路]] buddhist activities in [[敦煌]]，[[酒泉]]，[[洛陽]]，[[陳留]]
> "the history of the Buddhist Church before ca. 290 is still for ninety percent a history of translations. Translator’s biographies, colophons and catalogue entries give a rather detailed (though not always reliable) account of the formation of the Chinese Buddhist canon, but they seldom contain data of a broader historical significance."
— Zhu Shixing at Khotan [[于蘭]] 61
> [[朱士行]]from [[潁川]]
> "the journey of the Chinese monk Zhu Shixing to [[Khotan]] [...] is the first recorded case of a Chinese leaving his country in quest of Buddhist scriptures, and the first clearly localized Chinese account of Buddhism in Central Asia."
> [[求法]]
> "Zhu Shixing did not need to travel very far - he succeeded in finding the Sanskrit text of the Prajñ®p®ramit® in 25.000 verses184 at Khotan"
—The Church at Cangyuan and the translation of the Pañcavi%m˜atis®hasrik® prajñ®p®ramit® 63
> [[放光經]]transl by [[竺叔蘭]]
> "For more than a century this translation remained the most clear and comprehensive exposition of the Prajñ®p®ramit® doctrine which was available to the Chinese; both the Fangguang jing and Lokak◊ema’s Daoxing jing finally fell into disuse when in the first decade of the fifth century Kumarajiva’s versions of the Astassshasrika p’p’ (T 227, 408 AD) and of the Pañcavimsatisahasrika p’p’ (T 223, 403-404 AD)together with the enormous Madhyamika commentary to the latter scripture Da zhidu lun 大智度論, T 1509, 402-405 AD) at one stroke outmoded the work of the previous translators in this field."
—[[Dharmaraksa]] 65
> [[法護]]，Indo-scythian born 230 at [[敦煌]].
> "Dharmaraksa probably came from a wealthy merchant family which could afford to give its young members a Chinese literary education"
> "it was he who made from the hitherto rather insignificant Buddhist community at Chang’an the major Buddhist centre in Northern China, thus laying the foundations of the work which, some seventy years after his death, would be resumed by Dao’an and completed by Kumarajiva and his school."
—Dharmaraksa’s translations and the classics of the Mahayana in China 69
> "first complete version of the “Scripture of the Lotus of the True Doctrine”, Saddharmapu%n¥ar¬kas‚tra, 《[[正法華經]]》 (T 263）"
> resided at [[白馬寺]] since 289.
—Other translators of the Western Jin 70
> most important: Mokṣala [[無羅叉]]，Dharmaraksa [[法護]，[[竺叔蘭]]
—The formation of gentry Buddhism 71
> "If we attempt to describe the development of early Chinese Buddhism as one aspect of the social and cultural history of medieval China, we cannot but conclude that the years around 300 AD constitute the turning point par excellence. The penetration of the doctrine into the highest gentry circles virtually determined the course which Chinese Buddhism was to follow in the next decades: it paved the way to the victory of Buddhism in its conquest of China."
> "some late third century literati found in the foreign doctrine of the Void a new yet strangely familiar way of thought. Needless to say that their interpretation of the doctrine was coloured and distorted by their own cultural background, by the one- sided selection of topics, by the very language in which it was presented to them."
> [[清談]]
—Bo Yuan and Bo Fazuo 76
> [[帛遠]](子法祖） and [[帛法祚]]， sons of [[萬威達]]
> Bo Yuan built 精舍 in 長安.
> "Bo Yuan is the first Chinese master known to have entertained personal relations with the highest gentry, notably with a powerful member of the imperial house. In 304 the notorious king of Hejian and prime minister Sima Yong (?-306) abducted the powerless emperor Hui from the capital and entrenched himself at Chang’an together with the members of the highest aristocracy. Sima Yong was a friend and admirer of Bo Yuan"
—Liu Yuanzhen [[劉元真]] and Zhu Daoqian [[竺道濳]]（子法深） 77
—Zhu Shulan [[竺叔蘭]], Zhi Xiaolong [[支孝龍]] and Kang Sengyuan [[康僧淵]] 78.
> specialized in Prajnaparamita studies
> "Zhu Shulan’s drunkenness and offensive behaviour, though condemned by the Buddhist biographers who have hastened to insert a highly improbable story about his later return to a respectable way of life, reflects another important aspect of early medieval culture: spontaneity, anti-ritualism,eccentricity, freedom from and disregard of the generally accepted codes of conduct, an ideal which at that period is expressed by the word da 達."
> (he and his friends compared with the [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]])




=CHAPTER THREE: Buddhism at Jiankang [[建康]]and in the South-East,ca. 320–420 81=

東晉 (317–420)capital: [[建康]](before: 建業), [[王導]] （276-339）， 司馬睿
> "the history of the fourth and early fifth century may be divided in a number of well-defined periods, each characterised by the supremacy of a certain clan. [...] This scheme does not only hold good for the political history of the period. As we shall see, the early history of gentry Buddhism, especially that of the capital and the region to the East of it, is closely connected with the ups and downs of the leading families. We shall therefore describe the Buddhism of the South-East in ccordance with this chronological table." Table: LEADING FAMILIES and EMPERORS
—Mingjiao [[名教]] and xuanxue [[玄學]]86
> "Mingjiao and xuanxue cannot simply be regarded as two rival schools of thought.In many cases the two trends appear to have been adhered to simultaneously, one serving as a kind of metaphysical complement to the other."

—The Zhuangzi commentary of Xiang Xiu [[向秀]] （ca.221-ca.300) /Guo Xiang [[郭象]] （died 312) 90
> "The next step in the development of Dark Learning is an attempt at reconciliation of the two trends mentioned above: of the gnostic speculations propagated by Wang Bi and other “partisans of non-being” 貴無, and the theories of the more realistic adherents of the Doctrine of Names, “those who exalt being” 崇有.25
—Qingtan [[清談]] 93.
> 《[[世說新語]]》
> "the practice of qingtan was one of the most important factors in the spread of Buddhism in the circles of the highest gentry."

—The frst “Eminent Monks” at the southern capital and in the South-East 97
> "emperor Ming (323–326), under whose reign the power of Wang Dao and Wang Dun reached the highest point, appears to have been the first Chinese monarch with outspoken Buddhist sympathies and interests. In our opinion, the pro-Buddhist attitude (the origin of which is obscure) of this family, coupled with the most prominent position of the Wang in the first decades of the fourth century, forms the key to and the actual starting-point of the successful spread of Buddhism among the aristocracy of the capital and the South-East.This special connection between the Wang clan from Langye and Buddhism is furthermore attested by the fact that at least two of its members—both belonging to the nearest relatives of the two leaders—were priests, an exceptional fact which in the fourth and early fifth century does not occur in any other of the great families."

> [[東安寺]]
—Zhi Dun’s teachings 123
> Sages's traces, "that by which the traces are made" 所以迹 ([[郭象]]) -- hybridization of Buddhist and Chinese teachings
> central topic: 聖人， 至人 "who leads all beings to their destination by means of his compassionate teachings. He stands above and beyond the world of change 變 to which by means of his teachings he responds as an echo; the acts by which he interferes in the world of change are automatical reflexes which in no way influence his immovable and unchanging 'substance' which is wisdom and appeasement. His realm is not that of change but that of absolute truth, [...]. His realm is not that of change but that of absolute Truth, detached from all phenomenal existence and discursive reasoning. This truth is denoted by the term li 理 “order, principle”, one of the basic terms of the Chinese philosophical vocabulary which had already been used by several
authors since pre-Han times with different shades of meaning, but which here (as far as we know for the rst time) acquires a new and more abstract significance, the Chinese concept of cosmic or natural order having merged with the Buddhist notion of transcendental Truth, Suchness (tathatâ)."
> "The evaluation of Zhi Dun’s ideas forms a difficult problem. The Buddhist element seems—here at least—to be restricted to the notion of an Absolutum beyond the limits of discriminative thought, an equivalent of tathatâ rendered in xuanxue terminology by expression like, “utter non-being” 盡無, the “Mystery” 玄, “Truth” or “Order” 理 etc. The importance of this fact can hardly be overrated; it represents the beginning of a new phase in Chinese thought. When viewed against the background of early medieval thought, it proves to provide a new starting-point in the ancient controversy between the “partisans of non-being” and “those who exalt being” (cf. above, p. 90) by introducing a new and higher concept which formed the synthesis of both conflicting view-points. Here “being” and “non-being” are interpreted not as a pair of correlates, one being the function or manifestation of the other, but as two aspects of the same arcanum which embraces and transcends both."
> close to Wang Bi's commentary on 《[[道德經]]》 (p. 89)
> "It is not enough to note that there was a reorientation in speculative thought; the basic fact is that speculative thought, notably xuanxue, had by this time become the field of activity of a new type of people, the cultured clergy, of which Zhi Dun is a prominent example. Up to that time, Dark Learning—and philosophy in general—had been created and practised by literati, i.e., real or potential members of the bureaucracy, and ideal government and the means to realize it remained the central themes of their speculations, however unworldly these may seem to be at first sight. With the rise of the clerical intelligentsia in the early fourth century, xuanxue was transplanted from the bustle of worldly affairs into the relative seclusion of the monastic life, and here for the first time it became detached from the problems of social and political thought, to be amalgamated with certain elements of Mahâyâna Buddhism."
> "detachment from problems of secular thought and this stress on spiritual values and religious experience, unprecedented in Chinese history"
> wrote a commentary to one of the basic dhyana scriptures of the archaic period of Chinese Buddhism, the Anban shouyi jing 《[[安般守意經]]》
> "Zhi Dun’s world-view, like that of the other prominent gentry monks and laymen of the South-East, was no doubt predominantly intellectual; it was a pursuit of Wisdom rather than a devotional creed. The latter aspect is, however, not quite absent."

—Zhi Dun’s most prominent lay followers 130
> [[殷浩]] and 《[[維摩詰經]]》
> [[孫綽]] (ca. 300-380) 《[[喻道論]]》，"The basic theme of Sun Chuo’s Yu Dao lun is the reconciliation of the unworldly and a-social Buddhist creed with Confucianism with its stress on social virtues: the essential unity of “what is beyond the world” 方外 and “what is within the world” 方内."； "the duke of Zhou and Confucious are identical with Buddha [...] the inner fact is being awakened 覺"； "It is interesting to note that syncretism, the tendency to harmonize various doctrines, was applied by Sun Chuo as much to Daoism as to Buddhism. This appears most clearly from a short fragment of his “Eulogy on Laozi” 老子讚 quoted in Chuxie ji, where he applies to the Daoist saint almost the same words which are used in his Yu Dao lun about the Buddha."
> [[王洽]] （323-358）
> [[許詢]]五言詩
> [[郄超]] （336-377），most important because confidant of Huanwen [[桓溫]], father [[郄愔]] （313-384） follower of daoist 天師道, daoist and buddhist syncretism. "Xi Chao is, as far as we know, the only one among these gentry-devotees whose oeuvre included a considerable number of writings on Buddhism. We know the titles of no less than fourteen documents, mainly correspondence on doctrinal matters with Buddhist masters and laymen; some of these were polemical, defending Zhi Dun’s views against other theoreticians. One of his most important writings, a long treatise entitled Fengfa yao [[奉法要]], “Essentials of Religion”, has fortunately been preserved in HMJ XIII 86.1–89.2."
> [[謝敷]]

=CHAPTER FOUR: The centres at Xiangyang [[襄陽]], Jiangling [[江陵]] and Lu Shan [[廬山]], and the influence of Northern Buddhism 180= 
—General remarks 180
> three important centers:
> Xiangyang [[襄陽]] （漢江，northern 湖北） led by [[道安]], flourished 365-379
> Jiangling [[江陵]] （長江，southern 湖北〉 
> Lu Shan [[廬山]] （norhtern 江西）， established ca. 380 by [[慧遠]] （337-417）
> common characteristics of these centers with northern origins: devotional tendency, use of icons, dhyâna practices, effort to become free from chinese thought to get closer to teh "real message"
> tranferred to central China: fusion of Northern dhyâna and Southern prajnâpâramitâ
> [[道安]] building up a school of translaters and exegetes, later the seat of Kumârajîva
—Buddhism at Xiangguo [[襄國]] and Ye [[鄴]], ca. 312–349 181
> first half of the fourth century: concentration in Xiangguo [[襄國]] (S.W. of 邢臺) and Ye [[鄴]] (near 臨漳, S. 河北)
> disciples of [[佛圖澄]] (died 349) are the most prominent priests: [[竺法雅]]，[[竺法汰]]，[[道安]]，etc...
> only fragmentary information for the period of 320-380 in 長安 and 洛陽， almost everything on 河北， some on 山西 and 山東
> [[佛圖澄]] court-chaplain of [[石勒]] (r. 319-333) and [[石虎]] （r. 333-349） (see p. 85), arrived in Luoyang 310
> influence very strong, similar to the respected daoists [[單道開]] and [[竺佛調]]. more a great missionary and propagator than subtle exegete
—Geyi [[格義]] 184
—Dao’an and his followers in the North, 349–365 AD 184
> [[石氏之亂]]
> community at [[瀖澤]]: [[法和]]，[[法和輔]]，[[支曇講]]，[[竺法濟]]
—Dao’an at Xiangyang; monastic life and organization 187
> "The donation of private mansions to the clergy in
order to use these as monasteries had become a regular practice; as we have seen (ch II note 57), it is attested in very early times."
> "Another custom introduced by Dao’an at Xiangyang was the use of Shi 釋 as a religious surname for monks, thereby replacing the former religious appellations based on ethnika like Zhu 竺, Zhi 支, Kang 康 etc."
> "The large number of monks gave also rise to other organizational problems. The rules for the monastic life (律, Vinaya) were still very imperfectly known, in spite of Dao’an’s efforts to obtain more complete copies of these works. This seems to have been the reason why Dao’an formulated a number of rules and regulations, classified under three headings, a scheme of monastic disci pline which is said to have been taken over by the monasteries throughout the country."
—Contacts with gentry and court at Xiangyang 189
> "In spite of all these contacts, it seems that Dao’an and his community remained outside the political intrigues and troubles of the time. Xiangyang was far from the capital, and, moreover, situated in a region which during most of this period was completely dominated by the dictator Huan Wen until the latter’s death in 373."
—Religious activities at Xiangyang 190
> "Dao’an and his disciples were fully conversant with the current theories and speculations developed in the preceding decades in the South-East, all of which were primarily intended as explanations of the concept of Emptiness (無, 空)
versus phenomenal existence, or, in other words, the relation between Absolute Truth and Worldly Truth, as expounded in the prajñ®p®ramit®."
> "Dao’an belongs to those early Chinese masters who are credited with the establishment of particular exegetical “theories”; the one attributed to him is known in later scholastic literature as that of “Fundamental Non-being”, benwu 本無."
—Devotionalism 194
> "According to his own biographies and the more detailed account in that of one of his disciples,76 Dao’an assembled seven of his pupils before an image of Maitreya and made the collective vow to be reborn in the Tu◊ita heaven, in order permanently to obtain the guidance and inspiration of this superhuman exegete. The connection between this curious ceremony and the vow performed about thirty years later (in 402 AD) by Huiyuan and more than a hundred laymen before a statue of Amit®bha (cf. below) is unmistakable."
> "Summarizing we may say that the religious activities of Dao’an during his stay at Xiangyang, viz. exegesis of the Prajñ®p®ramit® and worship of Mai treya, seem to have marked a distinct phase in his life, partly explainable by his contacts with the xuanxue Buddhism of the South-East, and partly by his former occupation with dhy®na. Both aspects exerted a profound influence on his disciples, notably on Huiyuan who in the following decades would become his successor as the leader of the Church in the South."
—Scholarly activities at Xiangyang 195
—The fall of Xiangyang and the dispersion of the community 197
> Early in 378, when the alarming news of the approach of the Qin armies towards Xiangyang became known, Dao’an planned to resume his former peregrinations with his numerous disciples. His escape was, however, prevented by Zhu Xu who forced
him to stay at Xiangyang (cf. above, note 59). Zhu Xu’s reasons for doing so are not specified; it is not improbable that he wanted to use the presence of the great Buddhist master as a magical protection of the city against the enemy. It is characteristic of Dao’an’s feeling of responsibility that in this moment of imminent danger his first thought was for the fate of his disciples. When he realized that he had to stay, he assembled his followers and sent them away."
—The centre at Jiangling 199
> Tanyi [[曇翼]] one of Dao’an’s disciples who was of “Tibetan” (羌) origin, had become an abbot of the important Changsha 長沙 monastery at Jiangling, and this may have been the reason why several of Dao’an’s followers sought refuge at this centre after their departure from Xiangyang."
> Zhu Sengfu 竺僧輔 and Tanhui 曇徽 went to Shangming 上明 monastery at Jiangling
> Shi Fayu 釋法遇 went to the Changsha monastery at Jiangling
> Huiyong 慧永 at Xilinsi 西林寺 on Mt. Lu
—Other disciples 200
> "Thus the dispersion of the community at Xiangyang in 378/379 AD gave rise to or stimulated the growth of three important centres of Buddhism in the late fourth and early fifth century outside the southern Capital, viz. Jiangling (about which not much is known apart from the facts mentioned above), Chang’an and the Lu Shan. Of these, Jiangling and Chang’an had been Buddhist centres since early times. Huiyong is the first monk known to have lived at Mt. Lu, and the monastery where he stayed is said to have been especially built for him in 367 AD,94 so that no Buddhist community seems to have existed there before that date."
—Dao’an at Chang’an 200
> "The fundamental changes in Dao’an’s life after his transfer to Chang’an may be explained by the nature of his new environment."
> "Dao’an came to live in the immediate vicinity of his imperial patron, and as a result his position changed from that of a more or less independent Buddhist master to that of an excessively venerated “jewel of the State”, just like his own master Fotudeng once had been."
> "this period is marked by international relations, cam paigns to the West, a renewed influx of foreign Buddhist missionaries from Central Asia and Northern India, and consequently by extensive translation activities, now for the first time sponsored by the court, and for the first time directed by a Chinese master."
—Connections with the court at Chang’an 201
> "Under Fu Jian and his Chinese collaborator Wang Meng, the State of Qin had become thoroughly “confucianized”. Schools had been founded within the palace where “Scholars of wide Learning” instructed their pupils in the classics; a curious tendency towards Confucian orthodoxy coexistent with the stimulation of Buddhism led to a prohibition of the study of Laozi, Zhuangzi, and (partly Daoist) charts and prognostication texts (圖識)."
> Fu Jian officially ordered all scholars to submit their problems concerning Buddhist or secular literature to Dao’an."
—Translation activities 202
> "the period 380-385 was characterized by the influx of foreign missionaries and the translation of several important scriptures"
> "Abhidharma specialists Sa1nghadeva [[僧伽提婆]] and Sa1nghabhadra [[僧伽跋澄]] who arrived at Chang’an around 381 AD. Others, coming from the Buddhist kingdoms of Central Asia, were the Vinaya master Tanmoshi 曇摩侍 (Dharmadh¬?) from “the Western Region”, the agama specialist Dharmanandin 曇摩難提 from Tukh®ra, the abhidharmika Kum®rabodhi [[鳩摩羅菩提]] who had been the purohita 國師 of Midi 彌第, king of Turfan, and who in 382 was sent to Chang’an as a member of a tribute mission to the court."
> translator Zhu Fonian [[竺佛念]] "well-versed in Sanskrit and in several Central Asian languages. [...] Practically all translations of this period were actually made by him, the foreign missionaries mainly acting as informants “producing” 出(i.e., reciting or writing out) the original texts."
> "Dao’an’s role in the activities of this translation team was that of a “general manager” and adviser." 
> "Although Dao’an did not and could not take part in the work of translation itself, he appears to have been well aware of the problems connected with rendering the Sanskrit texts into Chinese. In his prefaces he mentions the opinions of himself, of Zhao Zheng 趙整 and of Huichang 慧常 concerning the dilemma which ever faced Buddhist translators: whether to make a free, polished and shortened version adapted to the taste of the Chinese public, or a faithful, literal, repetitious and therefore unreadable translation. Moreover, his preface to a new version of the Prajñ®p®ramit® (dated 382 AD) contains a highly interesting passage in which he formulates some rules stating on what points the translator should be allowed to deviate from the original (five points, the 無失本) and where he should faithfully render the Sanskrit text (three points, the 三不易).109 These rules seem to have become authoritative at Chang’an, for we find them mentioned in a contemporary anonymous colophon, in which the author refers to Dao’an’s preface containing these rules;110 they continued to be inuential in the school of Kumarajiva during the first years of the fifth century."
> "Dao’an at last obtained more satisfactory texts on monastic discipline (vinaya)"
—Shi Huiyuan [[釋慧遠]] (334-417 AD) 204
> "Huiyuan’s life and that of his clerical and lay followers are representative of early Chinese gentry Buddhism in its fully developed form"
> "In the course of our investigation we have met several types of partial absorbtion of Buddhism: Daoist practices with a Buddhist tinge, xuanxue speculations with Buddhist admixtures, retired literati fascinated by the monastic ideal, Confucian moralists attracted by the purity and the beneficial infuence of Buddhist ethics. This piecemeal digestion of certain elements from the Buddhist doctrine and way of life, which was going on in the South without basically changing the world-view of the Chinese intelli gentsia, had been interrupted by the establishment of an enclave of Northern Buddhism under Dao’an at Xiangyang, from where it extended its invigor ating influence to various regions of the empire."
> "Dao’an, for his interests and beliefs must have been as restless as his life, going through one phase after another: sheer shama nism at Ye, dhy®na in Hebei, gnostic speculations and the cult of Maitreya at Xiangyang, abhidharma-studies at Chang’an."
> "Whereas formerly the disputes about the status and raison-d’être of the clergy had taken place among the members of the ruling bureaucracy or at the court, now the Master of the Doctrine Huiyuan was on two occasions invited by the dictator Huan Xuan to take part in discussions about these subjects, and in doing so he became the greatest defender of the faith in the history of early Chinese Buddhism. The fact that Huan Xuan during his short reign as self-styled “emperor of Chu” in an
edict officially confirmed the independence of the Buddhist clergy i.e., their right “not to pay homage to the ruler” testifies of the immense influence and prestige of Huiyuan as well as of the privileged position which the Church had gained around the beginning of the fifth century."
> "Huiyuan’s activities on Mt. Lu partly coincide with those of the great translator and exegete Kum®raj¬va and his Chinese disciples at Chang’an, and the new ideas and scriptures revealed there virtually led to a reorientation of Chinese Buddhism."
—Huiyuan’s youth and early years at Xiangyang (334–378) 206
> "The decisive moment in his life came when on his way through western Hebei he met Dao’an who at that time had founded his monastery on Mt. Heng and there propagated the doctrine on a large scale. According to his biography, the young scholar was immediately impressed by Dao’an’s personality, and shortly afterwards “when he heard him explain the Prajñ®p®ramit®” he became Dao’an’s disciple and accepted the tonsure together with his younger brother; they obtained the religious names of Huiyuan and Huichi 慧持. Huiyuan, whom Dao’an soon regarded as his most brilliant disciple, and his brother remained with the master for twenty-four years, following him on his later peregrinations to Qiankou Shan, Luhun and Xiangyang."
—Masters and [[mountains]] 207
> "It must be noted that the strong association between Buddhist monasteries and mountains - especially “sacred” mountains - is a typically Chinese phenomenon. In our records we find mention of mountain-dwelling Buddhist masters since the middle of the third century, and in the historical account in the previous chapters we have met several typical examples. The background of this custom is no doubt Daoist, also in the case of Dao’an. In Baopuzi we nd a list of twenty-seven mountains which “according to the scriptures of the Immortals” 仙經 were considered especially suited to mental
concentration and the prepa ration of drugs of immortality."
> lived at following mountains: Wangwu Shan 王屋山, Nüji Shan 女几山 and Heng Shan 恆山
> "Xie Lingyun [[謝靈運]] (385-433) in one of his eulogies compares the beneficial influence of Huiyuan’s monastery on Mt. Lu to that of the “Vulture Peak” near Rajagrha where many sutras are said to have been spoken by the Buddha. In fact, several mountains all over China have been called Lingjiu Shan [[靈鷲山]], the traditional translation of Grdhrakuta one of these is already attested at the beginning of the fifth century."
> "Huiyuan, who around 380 AD came to live on Lu Shan, was fully aware of the “magical” atmosphere of this mountain appears
clearly from the remaining fragment of his “Short description of the Lu Shan” 廬山記 in which he describes the remarkable spots of the mountain and some more or less miraculous events connected with them."
—Huiyuan’s community: colleagues, disciples and lay followers 208
> “Dragon Source vih®ra” 龍泉精舍
> "Huiyong, who was still living at the Xilinsi 西林寺 and who apparently entertained relations with the highest provincial magistrates at Xunyang, persuaded the governor of Jiangzhou, Huan Yi 桓伊, to build a new and larger monastery for Huiyuan. This was the origin of the Donglin [[東林寺]] which under Huiyuan would become the most famous centre of Buddhism in Southern China and which also during several centuries after his death would continue to play an important role."
> "Huiyuan seems to have introduced a new way of preaching or explaining the doctrine, which is said to have become the general practice in later times."
> At the Lingyunsi 凌雲寺 the learned Hui’an 慧安 lived with a large number of followers around the beginning of the fifth century,147 and the GSZ speaks also of the vihara established by the unfortunate Tanyong 曇邕, a former commander of Fu Jian’s army who already ca. 386 AD had become Huiyuan’s disciple. A man of great physical endurance and courage, he had been frequently used by Huiyuan as a courier, going to and from between Lu Shan and Chang’an with Huiyuan’s letters to Kum®raj¬va and with the latter’s answers."
> "the famous Miaoyin [[妙音]] played an important role in the intrigues at court, as described above (p. 153)"
—Contacts with court and gentry 211
> Sengche 僧徹 (383-452), who originally belonged to the Wang clan from Taiyuan, and the able musician and calligrapher Daowen 道溫 (ca. 397-465), who was a descendant of the famous scholar Huangfu Mi 皇甫謐 (215282 AD). Both had become pupils
of Huiyuan at the age of fifteen, and there are some indications that Huiyuan consciously attracted young people from noble families to become monks."
> "The imperial sponsorship of Buddhism reached its climax under Yao Xiang’s successor Yao Xing 姚興 (ruled 394-416) who in 401 AD summoned Kumarajiva, until that date held captive by Lü Guang at Liangzhou, and under whose auspices and personal super vision this famous master and his Chinese collaborators carried out their work of translation and exegesis."
> "Wang Gong 王恭 (?-398 AD), one of the leaders of the military junta, appears to have entertained relations with Huiyuan and Huichi, and Huiyuan exchanged letters with Huan Xuan’s most trusted helper Wang Mi 王謐 who some years later (in 402) was to play such an important role in defending the privileges of the Church."
> "Huiyuan firmly maintained his role of “stranger beyond the world” by refusing to leave his monastery and to appear before the emperor, although he was urged to do so by one of the partisans of the new dictator Liu Yu. We hear about contacts with some leaders of the new régime: the famous poet and Buddhist devotee Xie Lingyun [[謝靈運]] and the young but very prominent
Liu Zun [[劉遵]]."
> "At this time of constant war and chaos, when the members of the higher gentry were tossed about and decimated due to internal conflicts between their cliques and factions, the community on Mt.Lu stood or pretended to stand outside and above the political struggles of the day. Judging from the facts mentioned above, it was indeed regarded as “neutral” and as
not involved in secular affairs. This is, in fact, repeatedly stressed by Huiyuan in his apologetic writings, and this was probably also the reason why Huan Xuan exempted the Lu Shan from the “selection” which he applied to all other monasteries, potential gathering-places of discontented and rebellious elements."
> "All these elements were found among the monks of the Lu Shan in a most developed form: Buddhist philosophy and xuanxue, dhyana and the cult of the supernatural, the beauty of nature and the ascetic life, qingtan, scholarship and artistic activities, unworldliness and political neutrality. To many members of the cultured classes who in some way had become acquainted with Buddhism and who were inclined to abandon the official career, the Lu Shan must have appealed as an ideal hide-away, a place not only of wisdom but also of rest and safety. Many of them came to live on the Lu Shan as Huiyuan’s lay disciples to take part in the religious life, and this remarkable influx of cultured laymen, in Huiyuan’s biography piously attributed to the influence of a miraculous statue, becomes fully understandable if we keep in mind the role of the Lu Shan as a combination of a religious centre and a collective hide-away for Buddhist-minded literati."
—Huiyuan’s lay followers at Lu Shan 217
> Liu Chengzhi [[劉程之]] (354-410 AD), commonly known as “Liu the recluse” 劉遺民
> “hermits” 隱逸

—“Dhyana” and the cult of Amitabha 219
> "On September 11, 402 AD, Huiyuan assembled the monks and laymen of his community before an image of the Buddha Amit®bha in a vih®ra on the northern side of the mountain, and together with them made the vow to be reborn in Sukhavati, the realm of bliss in the Western part of the universe where this Buddha was supposed to reside."
> "The “vow before Amit®bha” has been taken in later times to mark the beginning of the Pure Land sect 淨土宗, considered as a continuation of the “White Lotus Society” 白蓮社 founded on this occasion by Huiyuan, who thereby became the first patriarch of this school. Although this view is certainly not justified, as there is no direct relation, in the sense of a “liation of masters”, between Huiyuan and the later patriarchs of the Pure Land sect, yet this ceremony forms an important landmark in the history of early Chinese Buddhism."
> "This urge to have a concrete object of worship, perceptible by the senses, characterizes the Buddhism of the Lu Shan. Everywhere, in the biographical records as well as in Huiyuan’s own writings, we find the same stress on visual representation: the use of icons in meditation, visualization of Amit®bha, his hymns to the “shadow of the Buddha”, the dharmakaya (transcendent body) of the Buddha and that of the Bodhisattva etc. This curious feature, though perhaps partly a result of Huiyuan’s northern origin and the lingering inuence of Dao’an’s Maitreya-cult (cf. above, p. 194), is largely explainable by the lay element in Huiyuan’s community, people who needed something simpler and more “practical” than the laborious procedures of mental con centration and trance of the Hinayanistic type - a “method for practising samadhi whilst staying in the family” 在家習定法."
> 《般舟三昧經》 "The subject of this important s‚tra is a form of mental concentration which enables the devotee to behold all Buddhas “as if they were standing before his eyes”(現在佛悉在前立三昧)"
> reports of the death of Sengji [[僧濟]]
> "To Huiyuan, “dhyana” was much more than that. In one of his later prefaces he describes dhy®na as the counterpart of transcendent Wisdom, prajña (智). Dhy®na is “appeasement”, “tranquillity” 寂, absence of all mental commotion, which needs prajña to become fully effective; prajñ® is (intuitive) “reflection” 照, the non-discursive realization of Truth, which needs dhyana to become profound."
> "The study of the strictly monastic dhy®na of the Small Vehicle at Mt. Lu was no doubt much stimulated by the arrival of [[Buddhabhadra]] in 410 AD."
—“The body of the Buddha” 223
> "One of the most conspicuous elements of the religious life at Mt. Lu is the frequent use of icons and the importance attached to these. Here again the influence of Dao’an is perceptible - we may think of his vow before a Maitreya image, of the display of the whole iconographic inventory of his monastery and of the miraculous statue at Xiangyang on which Huiyuan wrote an eulogy."

> "The study of Abhidharma at the Lu Shan was much stimulated by the arrival of the great Abhidharma-master Sa1nghadeva (cf. above, p. 202) who first at Chang’an had made the Chinese public acquainted with the great scholastic literature of the
Sarvastivadins."
—Scholarly activities 230
> "Remarkable is the prominent role of secular studies and scholarship, no doubt again connected with the important role of the cultured laity at the Lu Shan and with Huiyuan’s efforts to attract these elements. It is, in fact, in his contact with lay literati that we see him engage in non-Buddhist studies. As a youth he had already been regarded as an expert on Laozi and Zhuangzi, and, as we have seen, he had been allowed by Dao’an to use the latter work in elucidating the meaning of Buddhist
concepts."
—The controversy of 402 AD about the status of the sangha 231.
> "Huan Xuan’s anti-clerical policy (cf. above, p. 214) reached its peak in the period when he was living at Gushu 姑熟 (E. Anhui) as a dictator, i.e., from April/May 402 until his final usurpation of the throne on January 2, 404 AD."

— Resistance against Buddhism in gentry circles: types of anti-clericalism 254
> "As has been said before, Buddhism, in China as anywhere else, was not a mode of thought or a philosophical system, but, primarily, a way of life, a code of highly regularized behaviour, believed to lead to emancipation (vimok◊a,
jietuo 解脫) from the fetters of birth and death and preferably to be pursued by members of a closed and independent religious organisation, the Community (sangha, zhong 眾). Being such, it was necessarily bound up with a monastic ideal which by its very nature was predestined to meet an intense resistance from the side of the Chinese ruling class."
—(1) anti-clericalism: political and economic arguments 256
> "The events of 340 and of 402 mark the beginning of a dispute concerning the status of the clergy which was periodically reopened and which was to last several centuries."
> "It was Huiyuan who was the first to give a clear and uncompromising description of the aims of the religious life in his letters and treatises. In these he preaches a clearcut delimination and separation of the sphere of influence of the church and of the secular sphere, not based on historical or utilitarian motives, but being the ineluctable consequences of the fundamental principles of the Buddhist doctrine itself. It is for this reason, and not because of the success of his apologetical activities (possibly brought about by wholly different causes), that it is fully justifable to consider Huiyuan as the first great defender of the faith in the history of Chinese Buddhism."
