> "During the period of a bit more than a hundred years beginning in late Han, i.e. from about the middle of the second century, one may deduce a development in Buddhist evangelism from the acceptance of the Buddha as a supernatural sylph, reflected in the evolution of the icon in the direction of a pure Budda-figure, a development so pronounced that the written documents, for their par, are already speaking in terms of households that venerate the doctrine of the 天師道 as against those that venerate the doctrine of the Buddha."
