<span style="font-size: 19px;"> An untitled poem</span>1
[Tang] Li Shangyin

====With our hampered trysts my heart aches to part from you**,**==== 
====When, in the late spring, the blooms fade and wind drops too**.**==== 
====I miss you as long as silkworms to death spin thread**;**==== 
====As candles drip till the wicks burn out, tears I shed**.**==== 
====To see your locks mirrored, the lost youth you’d bewail**;**==== 
====While chanting poems, of the moonlight you’d feel how pale**.**==== 
====’Tis near to your jeweled boudoir on the enisled Mound2**;**==== 
====To show my feelings, let the Blue Bird3 do its round**.**====

Wuti </span><span style="font-family: 宋体; font-size: 15px;">无题</span><span style="font-family: 'Times New Roman'; font-size: 15px;"> (the Titleless Poem). It is Li Shangyin that took the lead in giving such a title to his poems, most of which describe love, due to the unspoken assumptions or lack of an appertinent title. </span></span>

Legend has it that the place is inhabited by the celestial beings, which lies in the Bo Sea, off the coast of the Shandong Peninsula. Here it is metaphorically likened to the abode occupied by the lady that the poet loves. </span></span>
