=Viktoria von Winterfeldt-Contag (1906–1973)=
==Life==
Victoria Contag first studied history of art at the University of Vienna. This was followed by studies in the Chinese language at the China Institute in Frankfurt am Main, Berlin and Hamburg. For several years, after taking a doctorate in Sinology, she worked at the Museum of Oriental Art in Berlin, under Professor Kümmel, where she translated inscriptions on Chinese paintings. Professor Contag was asked to join the committee responsible for an exhibition of modern Chinese painting in Berlin which was organized by the Chinese Government. Following this exhibition in 1934, Professor Contag was invited to Peking. To protect the most valuable works of art of the Palace Museum in Peking from damage during the Sino-Japanese War, many of them were brought to Shanghai and kept in the strong-room of the Bank of China. In Shanghai she joined the committee of famous Chinese scholars who revised the catalogue and the valuation of the pictures in the Imperial collection. Together with one of the Palace Museum's advisers, C. C. Wang, Professor Contag visited the private collecitons of Chinese pictures from Ming and Ch'ing dynasties. This enabled her to make the necessary research for her book //Seals of Chinese Painters and Collectors// which was published in 1940 by the Shanghai Commercial Press. THe close contact with Chinese scholars over several years afforded her an opportunity to study Confucian education, which led to her book on Confucian philosophy. In 1946 Professor Contag returned to Germany where, until 1968, she taught Chinese language and Chinese philosophy at the University of Mainz.
