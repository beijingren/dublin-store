=池上看雨=
723

五月蓮未華
團團葉如扇
亭亭不自匿
一一出池面
細雨聽無聲
初於葉上見
綠盤擎不定
的皪珠光旋
流汞忽一傾
倒垂三尺練
萍開魚影聚
萍合魚影散
即事偶成詩
悠然觀物變

Its the fifth month [but] the lotus still has no flowers,
the leaves cluster like a fan.
Upright they dont bent to themselfs,
one by one they appear at the stretch of the poolwater.
A drizzle, even when u listen he make no sounds,
first you see him on the leaves.
